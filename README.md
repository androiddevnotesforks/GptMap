### Architecture Overview
![GptmapArchƒ±tecture](https://github.com/f-arslan/GptMap/assets/66749900/22b127cc-a8e7-4937-89b1-86b4f05090e3)

<p>This project is designed following the principles of Clean Architecture, utilizing a multi-modular approach. It includes several layers, including the UI Layer, Domain Layer, Data Layer, and the backend, to ensure a solid separation of concerns and enhance maintainability.

For the backend, Ktor for server-side logic, MongoDB for database management (Realm Sync and Auth for synchronization and authentication), Firebase for authentication, storage, and real-time database capabilities (Auth, Storage, Firestore), and GCP's Secret Manager for secure management of secrets and API keys.</p>
